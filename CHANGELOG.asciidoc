2023/05/12: Rebar3 is now used for autopatch instead of
            Rebar2. `make distclean` or `rm -rf .erlang.mk`
            might be required after updating Erlang.mk.
            Moving to Rebar3 increases compatibility now
            that few maintained projects are using Rebar2.
            For compatibility reasons the variables to
            point to a different rebar are now REBAR3_GIT
            and REBAR3_COMMIT.

2023/05/12: A number of broken packages have been removed.
            They were all unmaintained and there's a low
            chance that this will break anyone's project.

2023/05/15: Protobuff compilation with `gpb` now uses the
            `{use_packages, true}` option.

2023/05/15: Experimental support for caching git and
            hex dependencies has been added. Set
            `CACHE_DEPS=1` to enable.

2023/05/16: Remove support for HiPE and ErlLLVM.

2024/10/01: Initial beam-cache implementation. This is used
            to cache beam files when switching from/to test
            builds.

2024/11/14: Most packages in the Erlang.mk package index
            have been removed. To ensure that existing
            projects continue working, please add the
            relevant dep_* lines to your projects. If
            you were using dep_*_commit lines make sure
            to update them as well. Note that projects
            that have corresponding Erlang.mk functionality,
            as well as Cowboy, Ranch, Gun and Cowlib remain
            in the index.

2024/11/19: The deprecated defines `dep_fetch`,
            `dep_repo` and `dep_commit` have been removed
            in favor of their `query_*` equivalents.
+
            The deprecated define `dep_name` will be
            removed at a later date to give time to
            users to upgrade.
+
            The deprecated legacy fetch method has also
            been removed (`dep_cowboy = https://... ref`
            without an explicit fetch method). Adding "git"
            at the beginning of the dep line is the modern
            equivalent.

2024/11/22: Templates no longer use Make variables for
            substitution. Instead the strings template_name
            and project_name get replaced by their equivalent.
            Note that using variables in your own templates
            should still work, but that this way of doing
            things is deprecated. This change makes it
            possible to have templates outside of Makefiles.

2024/11/27: $(ERL) has been updated. It no longer starts
            the distribution, and limits processes/ports to 1024.

2024/11/28: Autopatching of dependencies that are using
            Rebar2 is deprecated and will be removed in a
            future update. Erlang.mk will always assume
            that a Rebar project uses Rebar3 from that
            point forward.

2025/03/18: Native support for Elixir was added. Erlang.mk
            will now properly handle most Elixir dependencies,
            as well as compile Elixir code in Erlang.mk projects,
            from both src/ and lib/ directories. This allows
            mixing Erlang and Elixir in the same project.
            Please refer to the user guide for more information.
            Native Elixir support is considered experimental.
